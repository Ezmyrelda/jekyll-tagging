By Arne Eilermann <mailto:eilermann@lavabit.com> and Jens Wille <mailto:jens.wille@uni-koeln.de>

jekyll-tagging is a Jekyll plugin, to add a tag cloud and per tag pages to your Jekyll generated Website.

== Usage

Install it:

  sudo gem install jekyll-tagging

Add the following to your <tt>_plugins/ext.rb</tt> file:

  require 'jekyll/tagging'

And in your <tt>_config.yml</tt> you have to define your layout used to generate tag pages like:

  tag_page_layout: tag_page
  tag_page_dir: tag

Now you got a new filter called <tt>tag_cloud</tt> which you can use with the <tt>site</tt> object as argument in your layout to get a cloud of all your site's tags. The tags are linked to their related tag page. Furthermore, you got a <tt>tags</tt> filter which you can feed withe a <tt>post</tt> or a <tt>site</tt> object to get a link list of all its tags.

=== Example tag page layout

  ---
  layout: default
  ---
  <h2>{{ page.tag }}</h2>
  <ul>
  {% for post in page.posts %}
    <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> ({{ post.date | date_to_string }} | Tags: {{ post | tags }})</li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>

  <div id="tag-cloud">
    {{ site | tag_cloud }}
  </div>
